Testing
-

> **jr** uses `karma`, `mocha` and `chai` for unit tests
> and `dalek` for ui tests

#### how to run tests?

just call `karma start` from root of repo (run `npm install karma -g` if karma not installed)

#### how to debug tests?

1. in karma.conf.js define `browsers: ['Chrome'],` and `singleRun: false,` to run tests in Chrome browser, not phantomJS (as default)
2. in your failing spec:
```
it('spec', function() {
    debugger; // This is like setting a breakpoint
    // ...
});
```
3. run karma
4. go to the newly opened chrome, open the console and refresh the page
5. now in developer tools source tab you should see the execution stopped at the `debugger`

#### how to create tests?

all unit tests located in `/test/js/` folder. how to create test using 'mocha', see [http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)

#### what located in 'reports' folder?
all reports generated by karma.

 * coverage - tool for see, how tests are covering code
 * junit and html reportes about passing test

#### ok, but what about ui tests?

all tests for ui is located in `/ui-test` folder
for run tests just call `grunt ui-test` command
